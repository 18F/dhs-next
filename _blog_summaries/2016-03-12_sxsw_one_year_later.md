Last year, I stood on stage at South by Southwest to share the story of the U.S. Digital Service and deliver a simple message: we need you to join us. The team was about 40 people and just getting started on using design and technology to deliver better digital services to the American people. One year later, my boss bumped me from the podium, but I’m proud to share all the progress we’ve made.
