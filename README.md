US Digital Service Website
==========================

This repo is for our public-facing site, which will be hosted on a to-be-decided domain.  This site is the main funnel for USDS recruiting and outreach.

Soon, this repo will also contain our assets on [whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service).

The site is built on the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and uses Jekyll to generate static pages.
