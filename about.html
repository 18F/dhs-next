    <p>
      Every day, millions of people interact with the government. We apply for Social Security and small business loans. We look for health insurance and financial aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too often, outdated tools and systems make these interactions cumbersome and frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if interacting with government services were as easy as ordering a book online? The challenges behind HealthCare.gov brought this question to the forefront, changing government’s approach to technology.

    <p>
      The U.S. Digital Service is a startup at the White House, founded by the President in August of 2014 to bring best practices in technology and design to government. We planned to hire ten people for three critical national priorities: modernizing immigration, Veterans’ benefits, and HealthCare.gov.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 2015 State of the Union address, we launched an online application to join the team. We worried if ten people would even apply. 1000 did.

    <p>
      We quickly went to work with a simple strategy:

    What was once one startup is now a networks of teams working across the Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, the Department of State, and Heath and Human Services.

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>
      How we work is as important as what we do.
    </p>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>1. Hire and empower great people.</h3>
      <p>Technology alone doesn’t change things — it’s the people who push our 
      mission forward. Strong EQ, compassion, and tenacity are just as important 
      as being a great technologist.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>2. Find the truth. Tell the truth.</h3>
      <p>We expect our people to be humble, not quiet, and challenge the status quo wherever 
      data supports it. To borrow from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: “Everyone is entitled 
      to their own opinion, but not their own facts."</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>3. Optimize for results, not optics.</h3>
      <p>We work for the people — not credit, prestige, or headlines. This means tackling the hard
       stuff, even when success isn’t guaranteed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>4. Go where the work is.</h3>
      <p>By working shoulder to shoulder with agencies, we’re able to inspire change. 
      Transforming government is not up to the Digital Service. It’s up to all of us, together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>5. Create momentum.</h3>
      <p>The American people need better digital services, today. We work with a bias 
      for action, focusing on delivery above all else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>6. Design with users, not for them.</h3>
      <p>To deliver products and services that provide value to users, it’s essential that we experience their experiences. The best products and services aren’t created behind closed doors.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
