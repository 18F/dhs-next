    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>
      How we work is as important as what we do.
    </p>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>1. Hire and empower great people.</h3>
      <p>Technology alone doesn’t change things — it’s the people who push our 
      mission forward. Strong EQ, compassion, and tenacity are just as important 
      as being a great technologist.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>2. Find the truth. Tell the truth.</h3>
      <p>We expect our people to be humble, not quiet, and challenge the status quo wherever 
      data supports it. To borrow from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: “Everyone is entitled 
      to their own opinion, but not their own facts."</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>3. Optimize for results, not optics.</h3>
      <p>We work for the people — not credit, prestige, or headlines. This means tackling the hard
       stuff, even when success isn’t guaranteed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>4. Go where the work is.</h3>
      <p>By working shoulder to shoulder with agencies, we’re able to inspire change. 
      Transforming government is not up to the Digital Service. It’s up to all of us, together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>5. Create momentum.</h3>
      <p>The American people need better digital services, today. We work with a bias 
      for action, focusing on delivery above all else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="usa-site-value">
      <h3>6. Design with users, not for them.</h3>
      <p>To deliver products and services that provide value to users, it’s essential that we experience their experiences. The best products and services aren’t created behind closed doors.</p>
