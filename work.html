      <p class="page-width-70">
        We live in a world where any new public policy is only as good as its underlying technology. Explore a few of the projects we've tackled:</p>

      <h3>Vets.gov</h3>
      <p>
        We're working with leaders across VA to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that consolidates information for Veterans. <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">One website—not thousands</a>. Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools and resources that are easy to find and use. Veterans are actively testing the site so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, Veterans will be able to find and access more of what they need in one place.

      <h3>Digital Immigration</h3>
      <p>
     With the U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS), we’re digitizing the review process for over six million annual immigration applications and requests. An increasing percentage of the immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has a 93% user satisfaction rate. Improvements to software development practices, system architecture, and design make it easier for users to interact with our immigration system.

      <h3>College Scorecard</h3>
      <p>
         <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd">We launched College Scorecard with the Department of Education and 18F</a> to help students make more informed decisions about college selection. Millions of students have already benefited from this data, the most comprehensive and reliable ever published on employment and success in repaying student loans. By giving developers access to an API, more customized tools can be created to help students find the right school.

      <h3>Caseflow Certification</h3>
      <p>
      Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability claim appeal decision, relying on a complex and duplicative process. We launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. A comprehensive solution required Congress to act, but this simple check reduces preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.

      <h3>Hack the Pentagon</h3>
      <p>To strengthen data security at the Department of Defense, the Defense Digital Service launched "Hack the Pentagon," the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: "I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security."</p>

      <h3>Precision Medicine</h3>
      <p>
        Announced in the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a new effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease by taking each unique person's genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Health &amp; Human Services is working to enable this medical transformation, partnering with NIH and VA to build their volunteer research platforms and the technology to support them, with the goal of gaining new insights for the development of individualized care.

      <h3>Student Loans</h3>
      <p>
        To help borrowers easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayments, the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education's
        Office of Federal Student Aid launched StudentLoans.gov/Repay. <a href="url">Built mobile-first and using human-centered design</a>,
        the site helps students find their best repayment options in five steps or less.

      <h3>Acquisition Training</h3>
      <p>
        In collaboration with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), we posted on challenge.gov, seeking a solution for how to apply best practices from industry to the regulations and processes that government employees face. The challenge winner designed a pilot to develop contracting officers who are successful in the era of digital government, empowering them to conduct digital service procurements and act as business advisors to CIOs and other federal stakeholders.

      <p>
        In the 2013-2014 Open Enrollment season, our team helped overhaul, update, and simplify the design and infrastructure of HealthCare.gov, helping eight million Americans sign up for coverage. Since then, U.S. Digital Service engineers have supported the day-to-day operations of the site, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html?_r=0">helping 20 million citizens get health insurance under

      <h3>U.S. Web Design Standards</h3>
      <p>
       <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/introducing-u-s-web-design-standards-aff21383afd6#.1vunnmtyr">Built in collaboration with 18F designers and developers</a>, we created the U.S. Web Design Standards. This guide creates a shared set of tools to provide consistent, well designed, easy to use government websites. The new system provides guidance for how to improve user experience by unifying visual language, navigation systems, branding, and interaction patterns.

      <h3>SBA Certification Modernization</h3>
      <p>
       For small business owners, navigating the contractor certification process is burdensome, involving hours of paperwork and scanning dozens of documents. We assisted the Small Business Administration (SBA) in establishing an agile procurement to modernize technology and streamline the certification process. The newly launched certify.SBA.gov saves small businesses time and money, and increases the SBA's capacity to provide small businesses access to federal contracting space and capital.

      <h3>Quality Payment Program</h3>
      <p>
     In addition to supporting healthcare for 55 million Americans, Medicare also uses data and payments to understand and improve patient care. But for the 1.2 million clinicians providing care, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) employees running Medicare, the outdated technology is difficult to use. Working with CMS, the U.S. Digital Service team at HHS is redesigning and upgrading the technology infrastructure and user experience, to provide patients and clinicians with an improved system.
