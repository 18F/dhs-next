      <h3>Caseflow Certification</h3>
      <p>
        Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability claim appeal decision, relying on a complex and duplicative process. A comprehensive solution requires Congress to act and the Administration has called on them to do just that, but we are also doing what we can in the meantime. With the Board of Veterans&#8217; Appeals, we launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. This simple check helps reduce preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.

      <h3>Hack the Pentagon</h3>
      <p>To strengthen data security at the Department of Defense (DoD), the Defense Digital Service launched &#8220;Hack the Pentagon,&#8221; the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: &#8220;I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security.&#8221;</p>

      <h3>Precision Medicine</h3>
      <p>
        Announced in the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a new effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease by taking each unique person&#8217;s genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Health &amp; Human Services is working to enable this medical transformation, partnering with NIH and VA to build their volunteer research platforms and the supporting technology, with the goal of gaining new insights for the development of individualized care.

      <h3>Student Loans</h3>
      <p>
        To help borrowers easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayments, the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education&#8217;s
        Federal Student Aid (FSA) office launched StudentLoans.gov/Repay. Built mobile-first and using human-centered design,
        the site helps students find their best repayment options in five steps or less.

      <h3>Acquisition Training</h3>
      <p>
        In partnership with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), we&#8217;re developing a more efficient procurement process for IT goods and services. To start, we posted on Challenge.gov, asking for training program ideas to make contracting officers successful in the era of digital government. The challenge winner created a training pilot to test with 30 contracting officers, who will complete the program empowered to act as business advisors to their agencies on digital service procurements.

      <p>
        In the 2013-2014 Open Enrollment season, our team helped overhaul, update, and simplify the design and infrastructure of HealthCare.gov, helping eight million Americans sign up for coverage. Since then, U.S. Digital Service engineers have supported the day-to-day operations of the site, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html?_r=0">helping 20 million citizens get health insurance under

       <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/introducing-u-s-web-design-standards-aff21383afd6#.1vunnmtyr">Built in collaboration with 18F designers and developers</a>, we created the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards to bring consistency and good user experience to government websites. This new UI system provides guidance for creating easy-to-use digital interfaces by unifying visual language and interaction patterns that meet high standards of web accessibility.

      <h3>SBA Certification Modernization</h3>
      <p>
       For small business owners, navigating the contractor certification process is burdensome, involving hours of paperwork and manually scanning dozens of documents. We assisted the Small Business Administration (SBA) in establishing an agile procurement to modernize technology and streamline the certification process. The newly launched certify.SBA.gov saves small businesses time and money, and it increases the SBA&#8217;s capacity to provide small businesses access to federal contracting space and capital.

      <h3>Quality Payment Program</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to supporting healthcare for 55 million Americans, Medicare also uses data and payments to understand and improve patient care. But for the 1.2 million clinicians providing care, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) employees running Medicare, the outdated technology is difficult to use. Working with CMS, the U.S. Digital Service team at HHS is redesigning and upgrading the technology infrastructure and user experience, to provide patients and clinicians with a better system.
