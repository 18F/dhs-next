    <p>
      <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">With more than 1000 websites and 956 phone numbers</a>, the VA customer
      experience is fragmented, frustrating, and confusing. Working with leaders
      at the VA, we are building Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that
      provides Veterans with useful information information that is clearly written
      and presented in one place. One websiteâ€”not thousands. Vets.gov launched in November 
      2015 in beta, and is being put in front of Veterans as early as possible so we can see, 
      as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, 
      Veterans will be able to find and get more of what they need in one place.

    <h3><a href="#">Online Immigration</a></h3>
    <p>
      We're partnering with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to digitize a formerly
      paper-based process to review over seven million immigration applications each year. Over
      a quarter of our country's immigration system is now digital, including the green card application (I-90),
      which has earned a 93% satisfaction rate from users. By working with USCIS to improve software development
      practices, system architecture, and design processes, we're giving new Americans a more efficient way to apply
      for citizenship.

    <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
    <p>
      For students, selecting a college may be the single most important investment
      of their lives, <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data on critical questions is a challenge</a>. We launched College Scorecard to empower students with the most 
      comprehensive, reliable data ever published on employment outcomes and success
      in repaying student loans. 1.4+ million students have benefited from these data,
      and the College Scorecard has been accessed over 9.4 million times in less than 6 months.
