        We live in a world where any new public policy is only as good as its underlying technology. Explore a few of the projects we've tackled:</p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.vets.gov">Vets.gov</a></h3>
      <p>
        We're working with leaders across VA to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that consolidates information for Veterans. <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">One website—not thousands</a>. Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools and resources that are easy to find and use. Veterans are actively testing the site so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, Veterans will be able to find and access more of what they need in one place.

      <h3><a href="#">Digital Immigration</a></h3>
      <p>
     We're partnering with U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) to digitize a formerly paper-based process to review over six million immigration applications and requests each year. An increasing percentage of our country’s immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has earned a 93% satisfaction rate from users. By working with USCIS to improve software development practices, system architecture, and design processes, we're making it easier for everyone to interact with our immigration system.

      <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
      <p>
        Selecting a college may be the most important decision students make for their future,
        <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data is a challenge</a>. With the Department of Education and 18F, we launched College Scorecard to help students make more informed choices with comprehensive data on employment and success in repaying student loans. Millions of students have benefited from this data already, and by giving developers access to an API, more customized tools can be created to provide students greater options for finding the right school.

      <h3><a href="#">Caseflow Certification</a></h3>
      <p>
      Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability claim appeal decision, relying on a complex and duplicative process. We launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. A comprehensive solution required Congress to act, but this simple check reduces preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.

      <h3><a href="#">Hack the Pentagon</a></h3>
      <p>To strengthen data security at the Department of Defense, the Defense Digital Service launched "Hack the Pentagon," the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program has won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: "I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security."</p>

      <p>
        Announced in the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a new effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease by taking each unique person's genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Health and Human Services is working to enable this medical transformation, partnering with NIH and VA to build their volunteer research platforms and the technology to support them, with the goal of gaining new insights for the development of individualized care.

        To help borrowers easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayments, the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education's
        Office of Federal Student Aid launched StudentLoans.gov/Repay. <a href="url">Built mobile-first and using human-centered design</a>,

      <p>
        By making the procurement process for IT goods and services more efficient, we can
        help make citizen-government interaction that much better. We posted an ask on
        challenge.gov: help us design a program to develop and produce contracting officers
        who can be successful in the era of digital government. The challenge winner designed
        a pilot being tested with 30 contracting officers, empowering them to support agency
        digital service teams, conduct digital service procurements, and act as a business
        advisor to CIOs and other federal stakeholders.

        In the 2013-2014 Open Enrollment season, our team helped overhaul, update, and simplify the design and infrastructure of HealthCare.gov, helping eight million Americans sign up for coverage. Since then, U.S. Digital Service engineers have supported the day-to-day operations of the site, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html?_r=0">helping 20 million citizens get health insurance under

      <h3><a href="#">SBA Certification Modernization</a></h3>
      <p>
       For small business owners, navigating the contractor certification process is burdensome, involving hours of paperwork and scanning dozens of documents. We assisted the Small Business Administration in establishing an agile procurement to modernize technology and streamline the certification process. The newly launched certify.sba.gov saves small businesses time and money, and increases the SBA's capacity to provide small businesses access to federal contracting space and capital.

      <h3><a href="#">Quality Payment Program</a></h3>
      <p>
     In addition to supporting healthcare for 55 million Americans, Medicare also uses data and payments to understand and improve patient care. But for the 1.2 million clinicians providing care, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services employees running Medicare, the outdated technology is difficult to use. Working with CMS, the U.S. Digital Service team at HHS is redesigning and upgrading the technology infrastructure and user experience to provide both patients and clinicians with an improved Medicare system.
