    <h2>Real Change at Scale</h2>
    <p>
  With headquarters in the Executive Office of the President and Digital Service teams networked throughout
  federal agencies, we can challenge the status quo. Explore a few of our projects:

    <h3><a href="http://www.vets.gov">Vets.gov</a></h3>
    <p>
     <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">With more than 1000 websites and 900 phone numbers</a>, the VA customer
      experience is fragmented, frustrating, and confusing. We are
        working with leaders across the VA to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that
         consolidates information for Veterans. One website-not thousands. Vets.gov launched 
         in November 2015 in beta and is being put in front of Veterans as early as possible 
         so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site
        progresses, Veterans will be able to find and get more of what they need in one place.

    <h3><a href="#">Digitizing Immigration</a></h3>
    <p>
      We're partnering with U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) to digitize a 
      formerly paper-based process to review over six million immigration applications and 
      requests each year. Today, more than 22% of our country’s immigration system is now 
      digital, including the green card application (I-90), which has earned a 93% satisfaction
       rate from users. By working with USCIS to improve software development practices, system 
       architecture, and design process, we're giving new Americans an easier and more efficient
        way to apply for citizenship.

    <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
    <p>
     For students, selecting a college may be the single most important investment
      of their lives, <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data is a challenge</a>.  In partnership with
       the Department of Education and 18F, we launched College Scorecard to help students
        make more informed choices with the most comprehensive, reliable data ever published on
        employment outcomes and success in repaying student loans. 1.4+ million students have 
        benefited from these data already, and by giving developers access to an API, more
        customized tools can be created to provide students greater options for finding the right school.

    <h3><a href="#">Caseflow Certification</a></h3>
    <p>
      Tens of thousands of Veterans are waiting longer than five years for a final disability claim appeal decision. This leaves hundreds of thousands of Veterans to suffer from ailments incurred during their time in service. In partnership with VA, we launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added to an appeal before it moves forward in the process. Through delivery of this small, but high-impact project, we're laying the foundation to build a VA that's worthy of the service and sacrifice our Veterans.

    <h3><a href="#">Hack the Pentagon</a></h3>
    <p>
       In an effort to strengthen data security at the Department of Defense, the Defense Digital Service launched “Hack the Pentagon,” the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program has won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: “I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security.”

    <p>
      Announced in the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a bold new research effort to revolutionize how we improve 
      health and treat disease by taking each unique patient's genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service team at 
      the Department of Health and Human Services is working to enable this medical transformation, partnering with NIH and VA to build their 1
      million volunteer research cohorts and the technology to support them, with the goal of gaining new insights for the development of individualized 
      treatments.

    <h3><a href="#">Acquisition Training</a></h3>
    <p>
By making the procurement process for IT goods and services more efficient, we can
help make citizen-government interaction that much better. We posted an ask on
challenge.gov: help us design a program to develop and produce contracting officers
who can be successful in the era of digital government. The challenge winner designed
a pilot being tested with 30 contracting officers, empowering them to support agency
digital service teams, conduct digital service procurements, and act as a business
advisor to CIOs and other federal stakeholders.

      In 2013, our team helped overhaul, update, and simplify the design and infrastructure of HealthCare.gov,

      supported the day-to-day operations of the site, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html?_r=0">helping 20 million citizens get healthcare under

    <p>
      When people go online to access government services, they're often met with confusing navigation systems, a myriad of visual brands, and inconsistent interactions patterns. <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/introducing-u-s-web-design-standards-aff21383afd6#.1vunnmtyr">Built in partnership with 18F designers and developers</a>, the U.S. Web Design Standards follows industry-standard web accessibility guidelines

    <h3><a href="#">Certify.sba.gov</a></h3>
    <p>
For small business owners, navigating the contractor certification process involves
hours of paperwork, scanning dozens of documents, and a burdensome user
experience. We assisted SBA in establishing an agile procurement which has
modernized technology and streamlined the certification process, saving small
businesses time and money. The newly launched site, certify.sba.gov, will increase the
SBA’s capacity to process socio-economic categories, providing small
businesses access to federal contracting space and access to capital.

    <h3><a href="#">Quality Payment Program</a></h3>
    <p>
      Medicare supports healthcare for 55 million Americans and uses data and payments to understand 
      and improve the level of patient care. But for the 1.2 million clinicians providing care, and 
      the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) employees running Medicare, the technology 
      is outdated and difficult to use. In partnership with CMS, the U.S. Digital Service team at 
      HHS is redesigning and upgrading the technology infrastructure and user experience to provide 
      both patients and clinicians with an improved Medicare system.
