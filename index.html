Millions of Americans interact with government services every day. Veterans apply for benefits. 
Students compare financial aid opportunities. Small businesses seek loans. Too often, these 
interactions are made cumbersome by outdated tools and systems.     </p>
    <p>
Enter the U.S. Digital Service. We pair the country’s top technology talent with the best public servants 
to improve improve the usefulness, user experience, and reliability of the country's most important 
digital services. </p>

     <p>
  With headquarters in the Executive Office of the President and Digital Service teams networked throughout
  federal agencies, we can challenge the status quo. Explore a few of the projects we've tackled:

    <h3><a href="vets.gov">Vets.gov</a></h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">With more than 1000 websites and 956 phone numbers</a>, the VA customer
      experience is fragmented, frustrating, and confusing. Working with leaders
      at the VA, we are building Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that
      provides Veterans with useful information information that is clearly written
      and presented in one place. One website—not thousands. Vets.gov launched in November 
      2015 in beta, and is being put in front of Veterans as early as possible so we can see, 
      as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, 
      Veterans will be able to find and get more of what they need in one place.

    <h3><a href="#">Online Immigration</a></h3>
    <p>
      Working with U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS), we're digitizing a formerly 
      paper-based process to review over six million immigration applications each year. Over a 
      quarter of our country’s immigration system is now digital, including the green card application (I-90),
      giving new Americans an easier and more efficient way to apply for American citizenship. The new platform has earned 
      a 93% satisfaction rate from users and USCIS continues to improve its software development practices, system architecture, and design processes every day.

    <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
    <p>
      For students, selecting a college may be the single most important investment
      of their lives, <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data on critical questions is a challenge</a>. We launched College Scorecard to empower students with the most 
      comprehensive, reliable data ever published on employment outcomes and success
      in repaying student loans. 1.4+ million students have benefited from these data,
      and the College Scorecard has been accessed over 9.4 million times in less than 6 months.
