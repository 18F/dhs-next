        Millions of Americans interact with government services every day. Veterans apply for benefits. 
        Students compare financial aid options. Small businesses seek loans. Too often, outdated tools and systems
        make these interactions cumbersome and frustrating. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the U.S. Digital Service. We pair the country’s top technology talent with the best public servants 
        to improve the usefulness and reliability of the government's most important 
        digital services.

        We live in a world where any new public policy is only as good as its underlying technology. Explore a few of the projects we've tackled:</p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.vets.gov">Vets.gov</a></h3>
      <p>
        We are working with leaders across the VA to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that consolidates information for Veterans. <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">One website—not thousands</a>. Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools that are easy to find and use. The experience is being tested with Veterans as early as possible so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, Veterans will be able to find and access more of what they need in one place.

      <h3><a href="#">Digital Immigration</a></h3>
      <p>
     We're partnering with U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) to digitize a formerly paper-based process to review over six million immigration applications and requests each year. An increasing percentage of our country’s immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has earned a 93% satisfaction rate from users. By working with USCIS to improve software development practices, system architecture, and design processes, we're making it easier to interact with our immigration system.

      <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
      <p>
        Selecting a college may be the most important decision students make for their future,
        <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data is a challenge</a>. With the Department of Education and 18F, we launched College Scorecard to help students make more informed choices with comprehensive data on employment and success in repaying student loans. Millions of students have benefited from this data already, and by giving developers access to an API, more customized tools can be created to provide students greater options for finding the right school.
