Millions of Americans interact with government services every day. Veterans apply for benefits. 
Students compare financial aid opportunities. Small businesses seek loans. Too often, these 
interactions are made cumbersome by outdated tools and systems.     </p>
    <p>
Our approach is simple: pair the country’s best public servants with top technology talent
to improve how government works for the people. With headquarters in the Executive Office 
of the President and Digital Service teams networked throughout federal agencies, 
we can challenge the status quo.     </p>

    <h3><a href="#">Vets.gov</a></h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">With more than 1000 websites and 956 phone numbers</a>, the VA customer
      experience is fragmented, frustrating, and confusing. Working with leaders
      at the VA, , we are building Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that
      provides veterans with useful information information that is clearly written
      and presented in one place. One website—not thousands. Vets.gov launched in November 
      2015 in beta, and is being put in front of Veterans as early as possible so we can see, 
      as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, 
      Veterans will be able to find and get more of what they need in one place.

    <h3><a href="#">Online Immigration System</a></h3>
    <p>
      For visa holders, a green card is essential and serves as a proof of
      identification and work authorization. Filing for a replacement green card
      can be an arduous process, involving lengthy paperwork and a six month wait.
      Partnering with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, we launched an 
      online platform to streamline the user experience. 300,000 individuals have
      filed the I-90 electronically since launch, saving an average of 20 minutes
      per person, earning the new system a 93% satisfaction rate.

    <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
    <p>
      For students, selecting a college may be the single most important investment
      of their lives, <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data on critical questions is a challenge</a>. We launched College Scorecard to empower students with the most 
      comprehensive, reliable data ever published on employment outcomes and success
      in repaying student loans. 1.4+ million students have benefited from these data,
      and the College Scorecard has been accessed over 9.4 million times in less than 6 months.
