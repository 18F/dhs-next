      Millions of Americans interact with government services every day. Veterans apply for benefits. 
      Students compare financial aid options. Small businesses seek loans. Too often, these 
      interactions are made cumbersome by outdated tools and systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the U.S. Digital Service. We pair the country’s top technology talent with the best public servants 
      to improve the usefulness and reliability of the country's most important 
      digital services.

  We live in a world where any new public policy is only as good as its underlying technology. Explore a few of the projects we've tackled:

    <h3><a href="vets.gov">Vets.gov</a></h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">With more than 1000 websites and 900 phone numbers</a>, the VA customer
      experience is fragmented, frustrating, and confusing. We are
        working with leaders across the VA to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that
         consolidates information for Veterans. One website—not thousands. Vets.gov launched 
         in November 2015 in beta and is being put in front of Veterans as early as possible 
         so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site
        progresses, Veterans will be able to find and get more of what they need in one place.

    <h3><a href="#">Digitizing Immigration</a></h3>
    <p>
      We're partnering with U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) to digitize a 
      formerly paper-based process to review over six million immigration applications and 
      requests each year. More than 22% of our country’s immigration system is now 
      digital, including the green card application (I-90), which has earned a 93% satisfaction
       rate from users. By working with USCIS to improve software development practices, system 
       architecture, and design process, we're giving new Americans an easier and more efficient
        way to apply for citizenship.

    <h3><a href="#">College Scorecard</a></h3>
    <p>
      For students, selecting a college may be the single most important investment
      of their lives, <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd"> but finding clear, reliable data is a challenge</a>.  In partnership with
       the Department of Education and 18F, we launched College Scorecard to help students
        make more informed choices with the most comprehensive, reliable data ever published on
        employment outcomes and success in repaying student loans. 1.4+ million students have 
        benefited from these data already, and by giving developers access to an API, more
        customized tools can be created to provide students greater options for finding the right school.
